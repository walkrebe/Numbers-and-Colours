"""
Please refer to colours.txt which lists three colours per line

Using the same approach as for the numbers exercise, answer the following questions:

1. Which colour appears most in the file?
2. Which colour appears in the fewest number of lines
3. How many lines contain GREEN but not BLUE
4. How many lines have the same colour repeated three times?
5. How many lines have three different colours present?

Bonus Question

6. How many lines contain at least one colour pair in alphabetic order? For example,BLACK,YELLOW is an
alphabetically ordered pair, whereas ORANGE, BROWN is not
