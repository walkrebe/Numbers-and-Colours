"""
Please refer to numbers.txt which contains 1562 lines, each with a number between 1 and
1563. Each number appears at most once, and one is missing from the sequence.

Please answer the following questions, either by writing a script (any language) to determine the exact answer, or pseudo-code/ a decision tree
to illustrate the approach/algorithm you would use to solve:
1. Which digit appears most in the file
2. Which number is missing
